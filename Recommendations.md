- Always assume heterogeneity (even in direct replications when multiple labs are involved --> cite ML1, McShane)
	- Do not trust p-curve and p-uniform, unless you have have convincing evidence that there is no heterogeneity (and how could you prove that?)
- Never trust a naive REMA, unless you have have convincing evidence that there is no publication bias and only medium amount of QRPs
- If a bias-correction method gives a significant result in the opposite direction, ignore the result; do not reject H0
	- (In general: Set bias-corrected estimates in the wrong direction (regardless of their significance) to zero?)
	- (Additionally: Set estimate to zero?)	
- Do not run p-curve and p-uniform on less than 4 significant studies
- 3PSM works best if you have k>=30 studies
- Do not trust 3PSM when it does not provide a p-value. Do not set it to zero.
