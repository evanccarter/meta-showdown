- Always assume heterogeneity (even in direct replications when multiple labs are involved)
- If a bias-correction method gives a significant result in the opposite direction, ignore the result; do not reject H0
	- (Additionally: Set estimate to zero?)
- Do not run p-curve and p-uniform on less than 4 significant studies
- 3PSM works best if you have k>=30 studies
