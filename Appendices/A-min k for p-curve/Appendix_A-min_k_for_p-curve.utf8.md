## Method ##

Effect size estimates and p-values from p-curve and p-uniform were grouped by the number of significant studies that were entered into the methods. Only groups with more than 10 simulated meta-analyses were used for the plots. Furthermore, we only looked at the conditions without publication bias (because conditions with 60% or 95% publication bias rarely had less than 10 significant studies in each meta-analysis).

Based on the results below, we decided to keep only p-curve and p-uniform estimates based on k >= 4 significant and directionally consistent studies.
